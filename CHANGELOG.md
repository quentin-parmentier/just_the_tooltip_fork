## [0.0.11+1] - Dec 14, 2021
* Controller is no longer `final`, which means it can be set and unset when the user provides their own controller.

## [0.0.11] - Dec 13, 2021
* Add `onDismiss` and `onShow` callbacks to trigger when the tooltip is shown or hidden.
* Includes `barrierDismissible` which will override background clicks. This allows the user to handle the state of the scrim programatically. Credit @atarbrest

## [0.0.10] - Oct 21, 2021
* Exposes JustTheInterface
* Updates readme to better reflect library

## [0.0.10-dev] - Oct 21, 2021
* controller is no longer an event based system. Instead, functions are copied from the state of the widget onto the widget.
* A field called `autoClose` was also added to the controller to mimic the effect of a pointer up event.

## [0.0.9+1] - Sep 29, 2021
* Fixed tooltip closing immediately when isModal is set to false and using a controller.

## [0.0.9] - Sep 29, 2021
* Fixed issue where hot reload would create skrim. Skrim no longer disables back button now.
* Fixed issue where tooltip would not update correctly from property changes.
* Added new tooltip property `triggerMode` and `enableFeedback`.

**[BREAKING]**
* Renamed JustTheTooltip.entry named constructor to other class JustTheTooltipEntry. This was necessary as the two methods were different enough to be their own widgets.

## [0.0.8] - Sep 10, 2021
* Added a `tailBuilder` for users to draw custom tails using their own path. Defaults to a linear implementation.
* Added pubignore for golden files
